# Weather App
## Objective: Become familiar with fetch API using https://openweathermap.org/api
### Lessons Learned: 
  - Cannot hide keys without using backend (process.env)
  - Chaining .then() with named function as an argument passes the 'resolve' value of the initial promise as the argument to the function
  - Event keycode 13 represents the 'Enter' key
